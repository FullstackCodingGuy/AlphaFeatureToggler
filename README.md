[![Build, Test, and Publish NuGet Package](https://github.com/FullstackCodingGuy/AlphaFeatureToggler/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/FullstackCodingGuy/AlphaFeatureToggler/actions/workflows/ci.yml)



## üõ†Ô∏è Building Feature Management Tool (with Microsoft Feature Management as Backend)

## üéØ **Primary Features**

1. **Feature Flag CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)**
   - Web UI and API for managing feature flags.
   - Ability to organize flags by project/application/environment.
2. **Feature Attributes**
   - Attach custom metadata (e.g., rollout %, allowed roles, expiration) to each feature flag for advanced scenarios.
3. **Targeting & Segmentation**
   - Enable/disable flags for specific users, groups, or attributes (e.g., by user ID, role, region).
   - Support for percentage-based rollouts (e.g., enable for 10% of users).
   - Feature-specific attributes for fine-grained control (e.g., minimum user tier, expiration dates).

4. **Multi-Environment Support**
   - Separate configuration for dev, staging, and production.
   - Promote flag values/settings between environments.

5. **Audit Logging & Change History**
   - Track who changed what and when for compliance and debugging.

6. **Instant Flag Updates**
   - Real-time (or near real-time) flag changes that take effect across services without redeploy.

7. **SDK/API Integration**
   - SDKs or REST API endpoints for your apps/services to evaluate flags dynamically.

8. **User Access Controls**
   - Basic roles/permissions (e.g., admin, editor, viewer) for flag management.

9. **Flag Status & Kill Switch**
   - Easy way to view all current flag statuses and instantly disable (kill switch) a flag across the system.

## üöÄ **Secondary Features**

1. **Custom Targeting Rules**
   - Complex conditions: combinations of user traits, geo, device, etc.

2. **A/B Testing & Experimentation**
   - Native support for running experiments and measuring results (may require additional analytics integration).

3. **Integrations**
   - Connect with Slack, Jira, GitHub, Datadog, etc., for notifications and workflow automations.

4. **Analytics & Usage Tracking**
   - Track flag usage, impressions, and impact on user behavior or system performance.

5. **Approval Workflows**
   - Flag changes can require review/approval before going live.

6. **Multi-Tenancy Support**
   - Ability to separate flags and access for different business units or clients.

7. **Scheduled Rollouts**
   - Schedule flag changes for specific times or windows.

8. **Self-Service API Keys & Webhooks**
   - For automation and integration with CI/CD pipelines and external systems.

9. **Localization/Internationalization**
   - Support for multi-language flag names, descriptions, and targeting.

## üí° **Recommendations for Building with Microsoft Feature Management**

- **Primary Features:** Microsoft Feature Management supports core flag evaluation, targeting, and integration with .NET apps. Build your UI, API, and audit layers on top of this.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Use Azure App Configuration with push notifications/event triggers for instant flag changes.
- **Extend Targeting:** Add user segmentation and advanced rules in your business logic/UI layer.
- **Security:** Implement RBAC and audit logging at your application level.
- **Secondary Features:** Add analytics, integrations, and experimentation as your user base grows.
